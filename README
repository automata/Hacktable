This project implements the Air Hack Table, an artistic or musical
instrument based on floating origamis observed by webcams. See

= The Code =

== Pure Data Patches ==

The file hacktable.pd is the main file, to be loaded into pd-extended
  http://puredata.info


== Scilab Scripts ==

In scilab/ you will find a couple of scripts, e.g. for color detection, which
were developed/fine tuned in scilab. These are not executed into the hacktable,
but are merely used to develp and throughly test different algorithms.
