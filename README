This project implements the Air Hack Table, an artistic or musical
instrument based on floating origamis observed by webcams. See

= The Code =

== Installing ==

See pd-macambira-install.txt

== Pure Data Patches ==

The file hacktable.pd is the main file, to be loaded into pd-extended
  http://puredata.info

== Pure Data Externals ==

See the subdir "cor" and the README file in there.

== Scilab Scripts ==

In scilab/ you will find a couple of scripts, e.g. for color detection, which
were developed/fine tuned in scilab. These are not executed into the hacktable,
but are merely used to develp and throughly test different algorithms.

You can test the color detection algorithm (or your modifications to it) to get
precise confidence numbers using our custom-made color detection dataset based
on origami papers and other color objects. You can find a link to this dataset
